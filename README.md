# Microservices Learning Repo

This repository follows my personal journey learning **Microservices with .NET**.  
We’ll start simple (Minimal API + EF Core + InMemory DB) and grow into a distributed system with:

- Independent services (ToDo, Catalog, Identity, etc.)
- REST + gRPC communication
- Async messaging (RabbitMQ / Azure Service Bus)
- API Gateway & service discovery
- Containerization with Docker
- CI/CD basics (GitHub Actions)
- Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)

> Work in progress — contributions, suggestions, and learning tips welcome!
